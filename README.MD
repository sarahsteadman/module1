# Overview
This is a Cryptogram program, designed to create puzzles for a user to solve. This is my first project using java. In it I explored how classes, functions, and various data types work in this language. I also learned about Java's use of libraries and packages.

This program provides the user with a word puzzle to solve. Each letter in a message is swapped with another letter and the user enters guesses which letter is which. After all letters are correctly guessed the user is congratulated and the program ends.

This program offers various features such as:
-Three levels of difficulty
-Optional hints
-Various messages to solve. 
-A restart function

I designed this program as a way to learn the Java language while having fun.
